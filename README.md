# Final-Project
This game is in the Dungeon RPG genre. You, the player, create a simple character, and start off immediately in your first dungeon at level 1. You progress through the game by completing dungeons; a bunch of rooms with monsters you must fight. Upon defeating a monster, you get some gold and experience that goes towards your level. The higher your level the stronger you are, which is important for when you progress to more difficult dungeons, where the monsters may be too much for you if you are a low level. The goal of the game is to complete all the dungeons, but it can still be played after completing this goal.
